## Build instructions ##

### Dependencies ###

Make sure the following library a installed on your machine. 

- [QT](http://qt-project.org/) 
- [OpenMesh](http://www.openmesh.org/â€Ž)
- [OpenEXR](http://www.openexr.com/)
- [CHOLMOD](http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/cholmod/)

CHOLMOD, OpenEXR, and QT can typically be installed through the package manager
of your Linux distribution. OpenMesh has to be downloaded from the given web site
and compiled from source. The build process utilizes CMake and present no major
difficulties.
